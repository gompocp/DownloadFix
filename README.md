# Archive Notice

For ease of use (and my sanity) I've moved this mod to another repo [here](https://github.com/gompocp/VRChatMods) with the rest of my mods so I don't need a seperate solution for each mod

# Important Please Read 
Hi, <br>
The devs are very much aware of this bug. According to some "secret intel" they think they know how to fix it so hopefully it should come soonâ„¢ and when that day comes if I catch a single person saying "oh wow about time they fixed it blah blah blah we had a mod that fixed this forever blah blah devs stealing code" I _will_ personally bonk you on the head. My fix is crap to say the least and useless to them and I can guarantee you that their eventual fix wont = my "fix". So be grateful towards VRChat rather than hateful when it comes out eventually. <br> Thanks!  <br> gompo :)
# DownloadFix <br>
- Yeah its literally a one line fix for the loading bug  <br>
- Adds a button to the UIX settings page and to the world loading screen <br>
- Don't really know what else to say about it so yeah <br>
